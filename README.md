A simple python code that takes screenshots of all the links you provide in a text file. Comes really handy while doing web app pentesting and bug bounty as it automates the task.
Basic intention is to quickly have a visual presentation about the all the subdomains and their statuses. I used this to check for "Subdomain Takeover".
